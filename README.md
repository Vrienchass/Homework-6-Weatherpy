#Observations
#1 Max temperature of cities is clearly related to proximity to the equator. In particular, from about -10 - 30' latitude appears to have similar temperatures. As cities are located further outside of these latitudinal lines, they have lower temperatures.
#2 There is an abundance of clouds in cities closer to the equator. There are no cities in my data set in the latitudes immediately surrounding the equator with 0 cloud cover. Cities further fromt he equator have more varied cloud cover.
#3 Cities close to the equator are very likely to have high humidity. Whereas cities further from the equator have more varied amounts of humidity. In particular, cities between the 20' and 40' latititudes are more likely to have the least humidity.
